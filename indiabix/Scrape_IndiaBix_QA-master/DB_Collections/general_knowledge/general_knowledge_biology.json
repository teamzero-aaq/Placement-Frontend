In between xylem and phloem bundles parenchymatous cells are present.\n(ii) Conjoint : In these vascular bundles xylem and phloem are present on the same radii. Conjoint vascular bundles may be collateral (phloem is present only outer to xylem) or bicollateral (phloem is present on both sides of xylem). If cambium is present between xylem and phloem then the vascular bundle is known as open, otherwise it is called closed.\n(iii) Concentric : Those vascular bundles in which one type of vascular tissue is surrounded by another type are known as concentric vascular bundles. These bundles may be amphivasal or leptocentric(phloem is completely surrounded by xylem) or amphicribal or hardocentric (xylem is completely surrounded by phloem).
