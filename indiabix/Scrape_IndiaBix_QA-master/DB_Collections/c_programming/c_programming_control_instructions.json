In the United States the acronym PEMDAS is common. It stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. In other English speaking countries, Parentheses may be called Brackets, or symbols of inclusion and Exponentiation may be called either Indices, Powers or Orders, and since multiplication and division are of equal precedence, M and D are often interchanged, leading to such acronyms as BEDMAS, BIDMAS, BODMAS, BERDMAS, PERDMAS, and BPODMAS.\nFor more info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations"}, {"question": "Which of the following cannot be checked in a switch-case statement?", "opta": "Character", "optb": "Integer", "optc": "Float", "optd": "enum", "ans": "C", "explanation": "The switch/case statement in the c language is defined by the language specification to use an int value, so you can not use a float value.\n\r\nswitch( expression )\r\n{\r\n    case constant-expression1:    statements 1;\r\n    case constant-expression2:    statements 2;    \r\n    case constant-expression3:    statements3 ;\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n    default : statements 4;\r\n}\r\n\nThe value of the 'expression' in a switch-case statement must be an integer, char, short, long.
