Since we can then be sure that the sum of that number and 2.5 will be greater than or equal to 2.5 and less than 3.5, we can be sure that Math.round() will round that number to 3. So Option B is the answer."}, {"question": "Which of the following would compile without error?", "opta": "int a = Math.abs(-5);", "optb": "int b = Math.abs(5.0);", "optc": "int c = Math.abs(5.5F);", "optd": "int d = Math.abs(5L);", "ans": "A", "explanation": "The return value of the Math.abs() method is always the same as the type of the parameter passed into that method.\nIn the case of A, an integer is passed in and so the result is also an integer which is fine for assignment to \"int a\".\nThe values used in B, C & D respectively are a double, a float and a long.
